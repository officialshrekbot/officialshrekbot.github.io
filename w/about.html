        <hr>
        <p>this is going to be all about the Shrek bot and this website I promise
            <br><br>
            this bot is a meme bot based on the character Shrek. It was made because all of the bots out there either don’t work or are offline. It has a number of fun commands and I try to improve this bot all the time. This bot has a number of cool commands that you can use and I add more all the time One of the main features of this bot is that there is a meme command that gets a random meme from the r/shrekmemes subreddit and sends it in the channel you requested it. 
            <br><br>
            as you can see this website has a free subdomain from a free host we also have the following subdomains for the Shrek bots website they all lead back to here some way or another shrekbot.is-great.net shrek.is-great.org shrekbot.is-great.org shrek.is-great.net honestly I don't know why we have so many it was late on a Friday </p>
